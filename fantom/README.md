## Fantom Ecosystem

I recently decided to try out Fantom.  I was hearing about all these airdrops, so blinded by alpha 
I decided to give the ecosystem a try.  This way around the peak of the polygon days (so far), and 
it was hip to bridge to other ecosystems and do degenerate yield farming.  This is what I decided to 
do. I put in some money and tried to rip it up.  

Here is what I found.
