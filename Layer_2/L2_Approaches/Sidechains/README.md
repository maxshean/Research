## All about Sidechains

A sidechain is a secondary blockchain that essentially lives alongside a primary blockchain, called the mainchain.  These sidechains operate independently of the mainchain and can have there own consensus algorithms.  Sidechains are connected to the mainchain via  a two-way bridge.  The two-way bridge is any means by which funds can be transfered from mainchain to the sidechain or from the sidechain to the mainchain.  There are many ways that a two-way bridge can operate.  They differentiate themselves through the cross chain transfer protocol: the protocol specifiying the rules for transfering funds between the two chains. 

Sidechains are typically smaller than mainchains, so it is easier for validators to form a quorum and fraud to occur.  

#### What is the difference between L2 and Sidechains

An L2 is a sidechain that is secured by layer 1 through proofs.  Pure sidechains on the other hand have there own consensus mechanisms that the mainchain does not track.
