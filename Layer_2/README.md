## Layer 2 

I am writting this research in early 2021.  Currently, gas fees on the ethereum network are absolutely insane.  I heard a rumor that I may have spent $200 dollars on a swap the other day.  As such, I am interested in Layer 2 (L2) solutions. 
What is an L2: 

If you think it is weird that I am investigating what an L2 is without definining a L1, go check out the Layer_1 directory in this repo.  

The defining feature of L2s are that computation is moved off-chain.  
These computations might be moved off chain for various reasons, but the primary goals are to enable greater levels of privacy and to save computational resources. 

Let's imagine a hypothetical.  Suppose you want to swap ETH for GRT.  You could go to Uniswap and do this.  You connect your metamask wallet to Uni and you approve the transaction.  This transaction is then broadcast across the ethereum network and functionally every node in the Ethereum network runs the swapping script.  This is a is a computationally intensive task.  

Okay, so you used uniswap, maybe payed upsettingly high fees, and you are looking for a work around.  

Enter L2.  Once, again you want to swap your GRT for ETH.  This time you head over to Loopring.  You pay a fee to move your tokens to the L2.  This fee will cost you about the same as a simple transfer fee.  Now you can swap your ETH and GRT and any other tokens to your hearts content.  When you swap in an L2 the computation is simply performed by the parties involved in the transaction. This greatly reduces the amount of computational energy needed to perform the swap.  Plus, an L2, Loopring in our hypothetical,  is built on top of an L1, the  ethereum blockchain.  As such, you enjoy the nearly the  same level of security that you get when you transact on chain. 

In this directory I will explore several topics. 

These include, but might not be limited to: 

- More info on what L2s are
- How L2s work
- My thoughts on L2s vs other L1s 
- Research into particular L2s 

There are various approaches to L2s. I will do research on each of these.
